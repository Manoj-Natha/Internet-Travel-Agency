# Internet-Travel-Agency


Steps to be followed for running this project:

1) Import online_travel_agency.sql for creating the database along with the tables and data.

2) Go to "localhost/index.html" it gives the index page for our program

3) Go to the login Tab and Sign up for a new user.(or use the existing user name & pswd ex: natha_manoj & qwert1234)

4) Now you can book tours or add to favourites

5) To login as admin goto : "localhost/admin_login.html"

6) The only user name allowed is admin and the current pswd is also admin (which can be changed in the database)

7) The admin can add, edit or delete a tour.
